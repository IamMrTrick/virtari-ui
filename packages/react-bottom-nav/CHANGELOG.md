# @virtari-packages/react-bottom-nav

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 08252d7: Own the primitive layer: every component now builds on `@virtari-packages/primitives` instead of `@radix-ui/*`.

  The behaviour layer — focus management, keyboard navigation, portalling, dismissable layers, floating positioning — has been forked into a new in-tree package we maintain ourselves. Component behaviour and accessibility are unchanged; what changes is who owns the code and what it writes into the DOM.

  **Breaking — anything that targeted the old names must be updated:**
  - Generated element ids are now prefixed `vds-` instead of `radix-` (e.g. `aria-controls="vds-_r_4o_"`). Affects DOM snapshots and tests that assert on ids.
  - Emitted attributes are now `data-vds-*` instead of `data-radix-*` — `data-vds-popper-content-wrapper`, `data-vds-focus-guard`, `data-vds-collection-item`, `data-vds-select-viewport`, `data-vds-scroll-area-viewport`, `data-vds-menu-content`.
  - Emitted CSS custom properties are now `--vds-*` instead of `--radix-*` — `--vds-popper-available-width`, `--vds-select-trigger-width`, `--vds-accordion-content-height`, `--vds-collapsible-content-height`, and the rest of the popper/toast/slider/scroll-area set.
  - Every `@radix-ui/*` dependency is gone. Apps that render Radix components _inside_ ours via `asChild` were relying on a shared Radix context; that context is no longer shared.

  **Also fixed:** `ScrollArea`'s corner never received its background colour — the stylesheet targeted `[data-radix-scroll-area-corner]`, an attribute the primitive never emitted. The corner now carries `.vds-scroll-area-corner` and the rule matches.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 4bfc69a: Fix radius token behavior in pill mode across the design system.
  - Keep the generic t-shirt radius scale finite in `data-radius="pill"` so raw `sm` and `md` no longer make cards, inputs, code blocks, editor blocks, or date cells fully rounded.
  - Add semantic radius aliases for button, action, input, segmented, code, color picker, editor, date picker, file upload, table, and navigation surfaces.
  - Make true action affordances fully rounded in pill mode, including buttons, toggles, pagination buttons, close buttons, input actions, tabs, and segmented controls.
  - Keep input-like fields rounded but finite in pill mode, with a stronger 16px radius instead of a full capsule.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- bdd9b44: Migrate redundant `data-*` state attributes to their semantic ARIA equivalents across the design system. Where a component already exposes `aria-busy`, `aria-selected`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-disabled`, or `aria-invalid` on the same element, the duplicate `data-loading` / `data-selected` / `data-expanded` / `data-disabled` / `data-invalid` is removed and the corresponding CSS selectors switch to the ARIA form (`[aria-X="true"]`, plus `:disabled` where applicable for native form controls).

  **Note for consumers:** if you wrote CSS overrides targeting the removed `data-*` attributes (e.g. `.vds-button[data-loading]`, `.vds-table__tr[data-selected="true"]`, `.vds-chip[data-disabled="true"]`), update them to the ARIA selector. Visual behavior, specificity, and component APIs are unchanged — only the styling hook moves.

  Variant attributes (`data-variant`, `data-size`, `data-color`, `data-state`, `data-active`, `data-readonly`, `data-placeholder`, etc.) are intentionally kept where no ARIA equivalent exists.
